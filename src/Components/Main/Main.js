      <p className="header">Design principles</p>
      <ul className="list">
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Little to learn</span>. Docusaurus should be
          easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will
          still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more
          time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong
          abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong
          abstractions. Mandatory talk‚ÄîMinimal API Surface Area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Intuitive</span>. Users will not feel
          overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus
          project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to
          build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Layered architecture</span>. The separations of
          concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling)
          should be clear‚Äîwell-abstracted and modular.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Sensible defaults</span>. Common and popular
          performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users
          but they are given the option to override them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">No vendor lock-in</span>. Users are not
          required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly
          encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and
          React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance
          optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown
          engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will
          be entirely up to users.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us
        become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining
        the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that
        users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be
        even more proficient in using it.
      </p>
      <p className="header">Comparison with other tools</p>
      <p>
        Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on
        documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to
        share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate
        through the prismatic choices out there.
      </p>
      <p className="mini-header">Gatsby</p>
      <p>
        <span className="green-light">Gatsby</span> is packed with a lot of
        features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing
        everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a
        higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for
        building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to
        do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily
        need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static
        websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many aspects of Docusaurus 2 were inspired by the best things about
        Gatsby and it's a great alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="green-light">Docz</span> is a Gatsby theme to build
        documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.
      </p>
      <p className="mini-header">VuePress</p>
      <p>
        <span className="green-light">VuePress</span> has many similarities with
        Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides
        tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is
        powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a
        Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.
      </p>
      <p className="mini-header">MkDocs</p>
      <p>
        <span className="green-light">MkDocs</span> is a popular Python static
        site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and
        don't plan to leverage React.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="green-light">Material for MkDocs</span> is a beautiful
        theme.
      </p>
      <p className="mini-header">Docsify</p>
      <p>
        <span className="green-light">Docsify</span> makes it easy to create a
        documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO
        friendly.
      </p>
      <p className="mini-header">GitBook</p>
      <p>
        <span className="green-light">GitBook</span> has a very clean design and
        has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting
        towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of
        its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects'
        documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products.
        You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams.
        Docusaurus is free for everyone.
      </p>
      <p className="mini-header">Jekyll</p>
      <p>
        Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has
        been a great tool to use ‚Äî in fact, before Docusaurus, most of
        Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is
        extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer
        experience as building a static site with Jekyll.
      </p>
      <p>
        In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added
        using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern
        JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites'
        performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set
        up.
